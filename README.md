# How to use it
create a `.env` file or change directly the `config.js` file

### if you use `.env` file
in `index.js` file, before all code, put
```js
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();
```
and start it normally with `node index.js`


### if you directly change it in the `config.js` file
just change the values there and start it normally with `node index.js`

## How to start the app?
